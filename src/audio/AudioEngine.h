// Custom output path: decoded samples (from QAudioBufferOutput) go through the equalizer
// into a ring buffer that QAudioSink reads from. The buffer keeps a "cushion" of ~200 ms.
// Nothing of it runs on the GUI thread: the samples are mixed on the decoders' threads (push() is
// connected directly), and the sink has a thread of its own — so a busy interface (dragging the
// window's edge re-lays it out for every pixel) can't starve the sound. The state is under m_lock.
// Samples that were actually played are kept for the spectrum analyzer — so the visualizer
// shows what you hear (after EQ), at the right moment.
//
// Mixing: the player has two "decks" (two QMediaPlayers). Each one's samples go to a separate
// queue; outside a transition only the active deck plays, and during a transition both are summed
// with envelopes that depend on the style (crossfade, filter, bass swap, echo). The mix happens
// before the equalizer, so the equalizer, limiter and visualizer work on what you hear.
